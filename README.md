 - Contact Modal : I have changed the close button in modal to word : "nevermind" , which was added in right top corner as well.

 - Services page : I have added a link at the bottom explaning that our service fees are provided on inquiry.

## Features

### The features implemented on this project: 

- Navigation : I included navigation bar on every page so the user can navigate easly and it links are styled simple and modern, with hover effects. The navigation bar was created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) .

- Background : I have added background image on all sizes with maching banner text and background image. The aim was to prove that visual user experience matters. Moreover, the font style of the website is lowercase because I am trying to show that something out of the ordinary can be attractive. By doing that, I have changed the usual word "Close" to "nevermind" as well.

- Contact form : I decided to change the typing style from "Contact us" to "say something" because I am trying to attract user's attention to details, thus leave a good impression of company's web design. A simple [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) modal was used in order to create a contact form pop-up. I have customized the buttons on modal and included hover effects which are not responsive on smaller devices, but this will be implemented in the future through media(hover) effects.

- Testimonial section : The word "Testimonials" was changed with "our clients love our work" to focus the user on positivity before reading and seeing our ratings and comments.

- Social links : Links to social media were included as a footer on every page. I have added hover effects to footer and matched the colors with point of view.


### The features I would like to add in future :

- I would like to add :hover effects on tap, as :hover effect works only on destkop view. The :hover can be added in the future through @media(hover) element
- I would like to add few more services on the website thus expanding the business.
- I would like to implement back-end technology and make this website a real Start-Up company for Web design.
- I would like to add a company logo.

## Testing
For code testing I used W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator to check every page and code of the project.
The results are as follows:
- [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
  - services.html -  No errors or warnings to show.
  - index.html - no errors / 1 warning found = The warning was a consideration to use h1 element only as a top-level heading,
  but in that case h1 element was used for that purpose.

- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
  - style.css - No error found.
  - The validator displayed 21 warnings. 9 warning were for -webkit/-moz/-o-background size's, and other 12 warnings were in regards to background color being the same. The CSS validator didn't recognize the hover effects and the reason for the same background color.
