## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

The main purpose of this project is to create a website that will support a newly created company. We as a company would build the website for them and they would be given various design options. From a personal perspective, I wanted to implement a new way of sentence structures by implementing casual speach and no capital letters in the sentences. We have entered a new age of development, which means that we need to focus on standing out. 

We would work closely with our clients to make sure we deliver exactely what they need. Our consultants will guide the clients by showcasing web desing elements and making them simple to understand in order to create a perfect working flow, and build a lasting relationship even after their website has been finished.



### User Goals 

- As a **user**, I want to understand the purpose of the web site i'm visiting at first encounter.

- As a **user**, I want to be guided easly throught-out the website.

- As a **user**, I want to read about the company's actions and the way they are dealing with Start-Ups.

- As a **user**, I want to read some testemonials to be sure this is the right company for me.

- As a **user**, I want to be able to contact the company and book a metting or get more information about their services and fees.


### Site Owner Goals :

- As a **site owner**, I want to be able to represent our company on the home page.

- As a **site owner**,  I want to attract the clients with special design as we are representing Web-develpment.

- As a **site owner**, I want to include navigation bar on every page so the user can navigate easily.

- As a **site owner**, I want to represent our services on a seperate page and add a button to a home page which will lead there.

- As a **site owner**, I want to showcast some of our reviews on the end of the page.

- As a **site owner**, I want include social media links as a footer on every page.

### Design

I wanted to implement a minimalistic approach to my design in order to make navigation through the website simple and efficient. I have used a color range of white and blue with contrast tones of orange/red to match the background image and give some dynamic to the page. I decided to implement hover effects to show the flexibility of the company and the ablity of customizing the site through advanced web-development. 

The site was created by Destkop first design because of two reasons :
 1. I decided to implement Desktop first design as I realized this would give me more coding knowledge, since I had to write more codes then I would have with Mobile First design.
 2. The company was made to focus more on Desktop user's as we are buidling websites for other companies and usually firms like ours are searched through desktop PC. Nevertheless, I have adjusted desktop, tablet and mobile view point therefore the site is fully responsive on any device.

#### Colors

Below are the combination of colors I decided to use on my website. I only changed the shades when implementing them on hover effects. I decided to use them as they are a good match with the background image used, which creates a nice dynamic look from the users viewpoint.

#### Typography

I decided to use two fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) throughout the website. A thrid font was used only in the services section for a heading. I used 'Poppin' and 'Chilanka' as general font styles, and 'Rock and Salt' for logo and services header. I decided to go for this combination of fonts as they were in my opinion the best suitable ones in order to better showcase the design concept I had in mind.

### Wireframes

Wireframes for the website were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). 
I also created wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop view. 
Below are the links to the wireframe pages.

 Extra features added :

 - HTML : The site navigation has been changed so that after clicking a navigation link it doesn't open a different page, instead it directs you to a section on that same page.

 - Contact Modal : The section under "say something" has been added afterwards, with a button "LET'S TALK". Moreover, changes were made to the Modal's "close (X)" button with the word "nevermind" and it was added in the top right corner and at the bottom. 

 - Services page : A paragraph was added at the bottom of the page explaning that our service fees are provided on inquiry.

## Features

### Existing Features : 

- Navigation : I included navigation bar on every page so the user can navigate easily and the links are styled simple and modern, with hover effects. The navigation bar was created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) .


- Background : I have added background image on all sizes with matching banner text and a background image. The aim was to prove that the visual user experience matters. Moreover, the font style of the website is lowercase because I am trying to show how something out of the ordinary can be attractive. To further highlight this I selected specific wording phrases such as the phrase "nevermind" insted of the traditional "close" button.

- Contact form : In coherence with the design, I changed traditional phrase "Contact us" with attention-grabbing phrase "say something". A simple [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) modal was used in order to create a contact form pop-up. I have customized the buttons on the modal and included hover effects which are not yet responsive on smaller devices, but this is planned out to be inplemented in the future through media(hover) effects.

- Testimonial section : The word "Testimonials" was changed with "our clients love our work" to orient the users focus on positivity before reading and seeing our ratings and comments.

- Social links : Links to social media were included as a footer on every page. Hover effects were added to the footer and I matched the transitional colors with the overall background theme.

### Features added then removed :
 - I had added a different picture to the mobile view, but decided to remove it because the change seemed to drastic and didn't align with the coherency of the overall design. I managed to adapt the initial background image, text and color when transitioning to smaller devices. For changing the header text, I used "display:none" to hide the previous text and then pseudo elements to make a new content. The old code of the website can be found under "Commits", which led to a bigger number of commites commited then initially intended.

### Features Left to Implement :

- I would like to add :hover effects on tap, as :hover effect works only on destkop view. The :hover can be added in the future through @media(hover) element
- I would like to add a few more services on the website thus expanding the business.
- I would like to implement back-end technology and make this website a real Start-Up company for Web design.
- I would like to add a real company logo.

## Testing
For code testing I used W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator to check every page and code of the project.
The results are as follows:
- [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
  - services.html -  No errors or warnings to show.
  - index.html - no errors / 1 warning found  
    - The warning was a consideration to use h1 element only as a top-level heading,
      but in that case h1 element was used for that purpose.

- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
  - style.css - No error found.
    - The validator displayed 22 warnings. Six warnings were for -webkit/-moz/-o-background size's, and other sixteen warnings were in regards to background color being the same. The CSS validator didn't recognize the hover effects and the point of the same background color.

### Testing User Stories from UX Section

   button was added to the landing page in order for the user to get more information about our service.

As a **user**, I want to read some testemonials to be sure this is the right company for me.

  - for a user, I've added a testimonials section at the end of the home page with our received ratings. By doing so, it attracts user's attention to our success.
