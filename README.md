## User Experience (UX)


### Project Goals

The main purpose of this project is to create a website that will support a newly created company. We would build the website for them and they would be provided with various designs. The website will show that we, as a company, have experience in creating new styles of websites that are attractive at first glance. I wanted to implement new looks of website styles,
as we have entered a new age of development. There is big competition on the market, which only brings needs to stand out.

### Design

I wanted to implement a minimalistic approach to my design in order to make navigation thru the website simple and efficient. I decided to design the website differently in destkop and tablet/mobile view. In destkop view, I have used color contrasts of blue with red tones, wheres in tablet/mobile view I used the same contrast in reverse. By doing so, I aimed to create a better visual dynamic in order to showcase the power of design.

### Wireframes

Wireframes for my website were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). I created wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop view. Below are links to my wireframes.

## Features

### The features implemented on this project: 

- Navigation: I included navigation bar on every page so the user can navigate easly and it links are styled simple and modern, with hover effects. The navigation bar was created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) .

- Background: I have added background images on all sizes with maching banner text and background pictures. The aim was to prove that visual user experience matters. I decided to seperate destkop and tablet/mobile view of the website as we are web development company, and this shows our flexibility with designs. Moreover, the font style of the website is lowercase because I am trying to show that something out of the ordinary can be attractive.

- Contact form: I decided to change the typing style from "Contact us" to "say something" because I am trying to attract user's attention to details, thus leave a good impression of company's web design. A simple [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) modal was used in order to create a contact form pop-up. I have customized the buttons on modal and included hover effects.

- Testimonial section: The word "Testimonials" was changed with "our clients love our work" to focus the user on positivity before reading and seeing our ratings and comments.

- Social links: Links to social media were included as a footer on every page. I have added hover effects to footer and matched the colors with point of view.


### The features I would like to add in future :

- I would like to add :hover effects on tap, as :hover effect works only on destkop view. The :hover can be added in the future through @media(hover) element
- I would like to add few more services on the website thus expand the business.
- I would like to add different design style only for @media (max-width:400)
- I would like to implement back-end technology and make this website a real Start-Up company for Web design.
- I would like to add a company logo.
